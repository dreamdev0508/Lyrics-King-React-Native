## Contributing :tada:

Due to time constraints there are several features that I havenâ€™t been able to develop yet. If you would like to develop your React Native skills and contribute any of the features below this would be hugely beneficial!

- [ ] [Debouncing or throttling](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/how-to-throttle-and-debounce-an-autocomplete-input-in-react) on search functionality.
- [ ] Adding clear search button functionality on Android. This functionality [already exists on iOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput#clearbuttonmode).
- [ ] [Animations](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/animations) would be a nice touch! Fading in the details screen background image would be priority.
- [ ] Any general performance improvements.

Other contributions and suggestions are always very welcome! [Contact me](https://www.stephenkempin.co.uk) if you wish to discuss anything.
